## My logic explaining how I solved the problem :

-   I created a output for the user to access the data. And then, I declared all the variable by using var and an array to contain the value of each variable. I created a function and for loop to execute the variable inside of the function.  
-   Push your solution on Github before 16h30, and send me the link to your repository on slack.

## Skills to be validated

-   Design an algorithm to meet specifications
-   Implement JavaScript syntax in a program
-   Clean code (indentation, comments, clear variables and functions names)

## Good luck, and happy coding âœ¨
